16165,S0022309315001271,Biosilicate¬Æ ‚Äî A multipurpose highly bioactive glass-ceramic. In vitro in vivo and clinical trials,"In this review we critically analyze 28 theses and dissertations and over 30 scientific papers that tested Biosilicate√Ç¬Æ, a highly bioactive glass-ceramic, in a number of applications throughout the past 20years. Biosilicate√Ç¬Æ presents a combination of positive features for bone tissue regeneration: it is highly bioactive, osteoconductive, osteoinductive, non-cytotoxic, non-genotoxic and has antibacterial properties. In addition, in the monolithic form, it is quite strong and tough. Its in vitro bioactivity is similar to that of the gold standard Bioglass 45S5. Biosilicate√Ç¬Æ has shown to be a very versatile, multipurpose biomaterial. It can be applied in powder, monolithic and 3D scaffold forms that could be easily machined during surgical procedures. This material has been successfully tested in a number of in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies, and several trials are ongoing. Biosilicate√Ç¬Æ is indeed a great option for a wide range of tissue engineering applications.",Phosphate glass,doi:10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2015.03.022,07/04/15,Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,"['Bioactive', 'Glass', 'Glass-ceramic', 'In vivo', 'In vitro', 'Clinical trial', 'Biosilicate']",31,8,1
3808,S0020768317304067,Risks of failure of annealed glass panels subject to point contact actions,"The strength of glass panels is normally expressed in probabilistic terms by the use of either the Weibull distribution or Log√¢¬Ä¬ìNormal distribution functions. Values of the modelling parameters can be obtained by calibration against experimental data. This conventional approach to probabilistic modelling has significant shortcomings as the extent of generalising the use of the calibrated parameter values is uncertain. The alternative approach of predicting the risk of failure is by stochastic simulations of Griffith flaws. The developing methodology involves the use of fracture mechanics theory and load duration theory. Limited amount of such simulation studies have been undertaken for predicting the failure of glass under wind pressure. In this paper, the stochastic methodology is further developed to simulate the risk of fracture of the glass panel when subject to the transient action of point contact that can be generated by the impact of hailstones or windborne solid debris particles. The flaw size distribution behaviour of annealed glass plate has been determined by calibrating against experimental results from the testing of glass panels of different dimensions and different rates of loading. Significantly, very good correlation between the simulated and experimental results has been observed across a range of loading scenarios when the set of modelling parameters characterising flaw size distribution was held constant. The introduced simulation methodology is aimed at bringing about significant savings by waiving away the need of conducting repetitive physical experimentation on glazing panels of different dimensions, and at different rates of loading.",Glass,doi:10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2017.09.001,05/09/17,International Journal of Solids and Structures,"['Glass strength', 'Loading rate', 'Probabilistic', 'Simulation model', 'Fracture origin']",26,7,1
15085,S1878535220300368,Crystal growth spectroscopic second and third order nonlinear optical spectroscopic studies of L-phenylalanine doped ammonium dihydrogen phosphate single crystals,The frequency doubling and tripling can be reached for Nd:YAG laser beam using the single crystal of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP). The growth and characterization of pure and L-phenylalanine doped ADP crystals are considered in the present contribution. The transparent good quality single crystals are grown using low temperature solution growth technique. The functional group alteration is studied using FT-IR spectroscopy. The larger improvement is observed in linear and nonlinear optical properties of ADP crystals on doping by L-phenylalanine. The reduction in charge carrier density is observed in photoconductivity spectra of all the grown crystals.,Phosphate glass,doi:10.1016/j.arabjc.2020.01.024,06/02/20,Arabian Journal of Chemistry,"['ADP', 'UV‚ÄìVisible spectroscopy', 'Photoconductivity', 'SHG', 'Z-scan']",13,9,1
3045,S0734743X16303049,Delamination properties of laminated glass windows subject to blast loading,"Delamination processes absorb significant amounts of energy in laminated glass windows when they are subjected to blast loads. Blast tests were performed previously and their results had been used to calculate the loads imposed on the support systems. In this research, the delamination process at realistic deformation rates was studied to understand the reaction force response obtained. Laboratory tensile tests were performed on pre-cracked laminated glass specimens to investigate their delamination behaviour. The experiments confirmed the presence of a plateau in the force-deflection graphs, suggesting that the delamination process absorbed significant energy. The experimental results were then employed to calibrate FEA models of the delamination process with the aim of estimating the delamination energy of the polyvinyl butyral (PVB) membrane and glass layers and its relationship with deformation speed. The delamination energies obtained through this research, if used with the appropriate PVB material model, are a valuable new tool new tool in the modelling and design of laminated glass fa√É¬ßade structures.",Glass,doi:10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2016.05.015,27/05/16,International Journal of Impact Engineering,"['Blast', 'Laminated glass', 'Delamination', 'Viscoelasticity', 'Numerical simulations']",23,6,1
3610,S0141029616300396,The mechanical response of cold bent monolithic glass plates during the bending process,"Cold bending of glass involves the straining of relatively thin glass components, (typically plates), at ambient temperatures, and is a low energy and cost effective manner of creating curvilinear forms required in modern glass applications. Cold bending is also popular because it is thought to eliminate the optical imperfections in curved glass plates that arise during alternative and more conventional thermal bending techniques. Experimental and numerical investigations on the cold bending of monolithic glass plates into anticlastic shapes are undertaken and described in this paper. The aim is to characterise the cold bending behaviour during the bending process and to evaluate the surface/optical quality of the curved plates. Two distinct phenomena of interest are observed: (i) a change in the deformation mode that under particular boundary and loading conditions lead to snap-through buckling and; (ii) a local instability termed √¢¬Ä¬úcold bending distortion√¢¬Ä¬ù that appears on curved plates when certain applied displacement limits are exceeded. This cold bending distortion is found to occur at stresses significantly below the fracture strength of the glass plate, but the distortions can be sufficiently large to breach optical serviceability requirements. An optical quality evaluation procedure for predicting the cold bending response and the resulting optical quality of monolithic glass plates are provided at the end of this paper.",Glass,doi:10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.03.019,28/03/16,Engineering Structures,"['Cold bending', 'Monolithic curved glass', 'Anticlastic surface', 'Optical quality', 'Cold bending distortion', 'Plate instability', 'Snap-through buckling']",21,6,1
14414,S2211379720304551,Ag nanoparticles localised surface plasmon field regulated spectral characteristics of Ho3+-doped phosphate-based glass-ceramic,"The holmium ion (Ho3+)- activated phosphate-based glass-ceramics with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) inclusion were prepared using the standard melt-quenching. The samples were characterised to evaluate the effects of different Ag NPs contents on their structure, microstructure and optical properties. The XRD pattern of the as-quenched samples revealed their glass-ceramic nature. The FTIR and Raman analyses showed the modification of the glass-ceramics network structure due to the embedment of Ag NPs. The TEM and HRTEM images together with the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption bands of the glass-ceramics confirmed the existence of Ag NPs inside the host matrix. The complex impedance analyses of the glass-ceramics suggested the glassy phase dominance in the host network. The photoluminescence (PL) peak intensities were significantly enhanced due to the influence of Ag NPs enabled LSPR effects. The PL decay curve analysis of the glass-ceramics indicated the effect of Ag NPs mediated amplified local electric field and energy transfer from the Ag NPs to Ho3+, a mechanism responsible for the optical traits improvement. The achieved branching ratio and stimulated emission cross-section of the optimum glass-ceramic for the three PL peaks were 73.88% and 46.68√Ç √É¬ó√Ç 10√¢¬à¬í21 cm2 (green); 83.97% and 41.12√Ç √É¬ó√Ç 10√¢¬à¬í21 cm2 (red); and 71.40% and 36.95√Ç √É¬ó√Ç 10√¢¬à¬í21 cm2 (IR). Based on the obtained findings, a structural-optical correlation was established.",Phosphate glass,doi:10.1016/j.rinp.2020.103102,,Results in Physics,"['Holmium ion', 'Glass-ceramics', 'Ag NPs', 'Absorption', 'Stimulated emission cross-section', 'Non-radiative decay']",19,6,1

In the energy range of 0.015√¢¬Ä¬ì15√¢¬Ä¬ØMeV, the mass attenuation coefficient (√é¬ºm), half value layer (HVL) and effective atomic number (Zeff) values have been calculated using MCNPX code for prepared glasses. Using the Geometric progression (G√¢¬Ä¬ìP) fitting method the exposure buildup factor (EBF) and energy absorption buildup factor (EABF) have been computed. In addition, the removal cross-section (√é¬£R) values for fast neutrons have been evaluated. Moreover, the mass attenuation coefficient for different compositions glasses have been calculated using XMuDat program and XCOM and have been compared with MCNPX values. The √é¬ºm, HVL and √é¬£R values of the investigated glass samples have been compared with the different types of concretes in other glass materials. Using the pulse-echo technique, the elastic moduli for glass samples have been measured. The glass sample 30Bi2O3-40B2O3-20SiO2-9Na2O-1Fe2O3 shows the highest values of √é¬ºm and lowest values of HVL, which indicate that this glass composition is the most effective at radiation shielding.",Glass,doi:10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102165,05/03/19,Results in Physics,"['Shielding properties', 'Fast neutron', 'MCNPX', 'XMuDat', 'Elastic moduli']",19,6,1
14476,S0022309317304921,Formation structure and properties of fluoro-sulfo-phosphate poly-anionic glasses,"Phosphate glasses exhibit high solubility for secondary anion species. This includes sulfate, fluoride or nitride ions, and enables the preparation of poly-anionic glasses. Here, we consider fluoro-sulfo-phosphates. We show that in this system, even equimolar anion mixing can be achieved without notably compromising the glass forming ability. The derived glasses exhibit surprising stability, what enables the fabrication of bulk samples mostly without the need to employ rapid quenching techniques. In terms of molecular structure, they rely on primarily ionic bonding among the different constituents, whereby the fluoride and sulfate anions seem to act as stabilizing ionic cross-linkers between highly-depolymerized phosphate entities. Investigation of the low-frequency Raman scattering indicates characteristic variations on intermediate-range structure, where a shift in the Boson peak appears to correlate inversely with increasing sulfate content. We discuss this observation in terms of the low level of bond localization and low field strength of the sulfate anion relative to phosphate Q 0 groups. Adjusting the degree of anion competition enables to tailor super-structural heterogeneity. Beyond this, the glass system provides an interesting variety of ligand situations for the potential incorporation of optically active cation species.",Phosphate glass,doi:10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2017.09.043,01/10/17,Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,"['Phosphate', 'Sulphate', 'Fluoride', 'Multi-anion', 'Anion mixing']",16,5,1
15831,S2590159119300391,Review on the structural analysis of fluoride-phosphate and fluoro-phosphate glasses,"Fluoride phosphate/fluorophosphate (FP) glasses form an intriguing material's basis for diverse applications in optics, photonics and energy storage. The optimization of the materials' properties with regard to the application envisioned demands an understanding of the key concepts describing their local structures on different distance regimes. Because of the inevitable losses of fluoride during melting or annealing, the synthesis and elemental analytical characterization present important and critical challenges. In this contribution we summarize the current state of the literature regarding the structural characterization of these glasses. Foci are the detailed analysis of vibrational spectra with special emphasis on Raman scattering results and multinuclear solid-state NMR spectroscopy. While vibrational spectra give important information about the local environments (short range order) advanced multi-dimensional and multi-resonance methodology can extend the informational content of solid-state NMR into the sub-nanometer distance range, including second and third coordination spheres. Exemplary results will be presented for (a) aluminum fluoride based simple model systems, (b) fluoride phosphate glasses containing heavy transition metals or post-transition metal elements, and (c) rare-earth doped fluoride phosphate glasses for laser applications. The latter application field documents the utility of correlated spectroscopic studies using both methods in understanding the structural foundations of photophysical properties.",Phosphate glass,doi:10.1016/j.nocx.2019.100026,15/06/19,Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids: X,"['Fluoride phosphate and fluoro-phosphate glasses', 'Analysis', 'NMR spectroscopy', 'ESR spectroscopy', 'Raman and IR', 'Spectroscopy', 'Structure']",15,5,1
14582,S0167273816302958,Lithium diffusion coefficient in amorphous lithium phosphate thin films measured by secondary ion mass spectroscopy with isotope exchange methods,"Lithium diffusion coefficients in amorphous lithium phosphate (a-Li3PO4) thin films were determined by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), using 7Li and 6Li stable isotopes. The diffusion couples were prepared by an ion-exchange method using liquid electrolyte and a mask method based on thin-film deposition. The tracer diffusion coefficient, D Li √¢¬Å¬é, was evaluated by analyzing the isotope profiles obtained by SIMS in the temperature range of 25√¢¬Ä¬ì160√Ç¬∞C.
