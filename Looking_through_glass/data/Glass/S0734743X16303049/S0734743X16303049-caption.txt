Fig. 1-S0734743X16303049,2,Typical blast and DIC set up and results from a blast test (30 kg TNT equivalent at 16 m). The DIC set up is shown (not to scale) (a); together with the pressure time trace (b) and the deflected profile of the glazing sample (c). The raw high speed images and DIC results are also shown at the same three time points as the deflected profiles (d)

Fig. 15-S0734743X16303049,2,Experimental force per unit width and strain against the overall deformation for the 10 m/s experiments. The 1.52 mm results are shown up to 20 mm as the exact displacement was difficult to measure after this point due to glass failures; however; force results were collected up to approximately 40 mm displacement for the plateau stress calculation.
