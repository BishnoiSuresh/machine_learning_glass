Fig. 7-S2590159119300391,1,31P{19F} REDOR dephasing curves for selected (70-x)(NaF) - x(WO3) - 30(NaPO3) glasses; revealing a dramatic drop in the strength of 31P-19F dipole-dipole interactions with increasing WO3 content. WO3-rich glasses attract the NaF species preferentially; forming W-F bonds that are remote from the glass network structure. Dashed curves are parabolic fits; analyzed within the data range ∆S/S0 ≤ 0.2. Measurements at a magnetic field strength of 5.7 T.

Scheme 1-S2590159119300391,1,Lewis structures present in phosphate and FP glasses and crystals reflecting different P-OT bond orders. The metaphosphate group Ø2PO2− (a) the fluorinated terminal units ØFPO2− (b) and the monomeric species F2PO22− (c) possess the same bond order of 1.5. Likewise; the pyrophosphate ØPO32− (d) and the monomeric FPO32− ion (e) have the same P-OT bond order of 1.33. The P-OT bond orders of the monomeric units (c); (e); and the orthophosphate PO43− (f) are all different and are expected to have different Raman signatures.
